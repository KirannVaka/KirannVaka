### If you are a recruiter. Please check out my projects:
#### React Projects
##### Using React Hooks
1. [**recepie-book**](https://kirannvaka.github.io/recepie-book/): It is a react website that provodies recepies for diffrent meals and lets you save your favorite recepies.
2. [**team-member-allocation**](https://kirannvaka.github.io/team-member-allocation): A react project to helps managers/employers keep track of teams and thair team members. Ideal for work spaces that have team members working on varios projects.
##### Using React Classes
3. **vidly**: My first react project that I built following along lectures. This react website is for video rental store. Customers can pick their favorite movies and staff can manage the data on the website.  
**The project in not finished. The dependencies used in lectures were old and was leading to errors while building**
#### Javascript, HTML and CSS project
4. [**memomry-match**](https://kirannvaka.github.io/Memory-Match/): This is my first javscript, html and css project. It is a educational matching game with muliple levels. The game gets diffcult as the levels increase and switch tactics every alternate round. For further deatails check the project.

*Note: The commits performed are frequent in the above react projects, inorder for recruiters to understand my learning skills and thought process.*
